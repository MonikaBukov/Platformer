## About the Project

In my game project, I've crafted an engaging and enjoyable experience. Players have praised the smooth movement and a unique rock-throwing mechanic to defeat enemies. However, I acknowledge some areas for improvement, such as refining collision zones, addressing movement speed concerns, and fixing a minor bug related to mid-air jumping.

In terms of implementation, I've taken great care to maintain a well-structured codebase. I've designed numerous classes with logical relationships, ensuring data and functions are organized effectively. Notably, I've coded the tilemap and collision systems from scratch, showcasing my problem-solving skills. I've managed dynamic memory allocation proficiently and even incorporated virtual functions.
